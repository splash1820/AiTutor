      "explanation": "The `int` data type in C++ is used to store integer values (whole numbers).  Its range is limited by the system's architecture (typically 32 or 64 bits), meaning it cannot store arbitrarily large integers.  While it can hold both positive and negative numbers, it cannot directly represent numbers with fractional parts (that requires `float` or `double`).  Options A, C, and D describe `float`, `char`, and `bool` data types respectively."

If an overflow is detected, it prints \"Overflow!\". Otherwise, it safely casts the `long long` volume to an `int` and prints the volume.

Explain how the `int` data type differs from other integral data types such as `short`, `long`, and `long long`.",
      "answer": "In C++, the `int` data type is a fundamental data type used to store integer values, meaning whole numbers without any fractional part. Its primary purpose is to represent numerical data in various applications.\n\nThe range of values an `int` can hold is platform-dependent; it depends on the compiler and the underlying architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).  Typically, a 32-bit system uses a 32-bit `int`, allowing it to represent integers from approximately -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. On a 64-bit system, an `int` might also be 64 bits, significantly expanding its range.  However, it is crucial to note that the specific size and range can vary and are not guaranteed to be consistent across different systems.  This is why using `limits.h` (or `climits`) is important to determine the actual minimum and maximum values.\n\nAn `int` typically occupies 4 bytes (32 bits) of memory on most systems. This means it uses 4 bytes to store a single integer value.\n\nA significant issue associated with `int` is integer overflow. This occurs when an arithmetic operation results in a value that exceeds the maximum or minimum value representable by an `int`.  This can lead to unexpected and incorrect results or program crashes. For example, adding two very large positive integers might result in a negative value due to overflow (wraparound).\n\nHere are examples of declaring and using `int`:\n\n```c++\n#include <iostream>\n#include <limits> // To access limits on int\n\nint main() {\n  int age = 30;\n  int sum = 10 + 20;\n  int product = age * sum;\n  std::cout << \"Age: \" << age << std::endl;\n  std::cout << \"Sum: \" << sum << std::endl;\n  std::cout << \"Product: \" << product << std::endl;\n  std::cout << \"Minimum int value: \" << std::numeric_limits<int>::min() << std::endl;\n  std::cout << \"Maximum int value: \" << std::numeric_limits<int>::max() << std::endl;\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n`int` differs from other integral types like `short`, `long`, and `long long` primarily in its size and, consequently, its range.  `short int` usually uses less memory (often 2 bytes), making it suitable for smaller integers. `long int` and `long long int` use more memory (often 4 or 8 bytes, respectively), enabling them to store much larger integers than `int`.  The exact sizes of these types can vary across systems, making it advisable to use `sizeof()` operator to determine the size of these data types in your specific environment.  Choosing the appropriate integral type depends on the expected range of values.",
      "explanation": "A good answer should include these key points: * **Purpose:** Stores integer values (whole numbers).\n* **Size:** Typically 4 bytes (32 bits), but platform-dependent; use `sizeof(int)` to check.\n* **Range:** Platform-dependent;  determine using `limits.h` (or `climits`).\n* **Integer Overflow:**  A critical issue to consider; it occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum or minimum representable value.\n* **Declaration and Usage:** Examples of declaration and basic arithmetic operations must be shown.\n* **Comparison with other integral types:**  Explain the differences and relative sizes of `short`, `long`, and `long long` integers, emphasizing that their sizes are implementation defined.\n* **Platform Dependency:** Explicitly stating that the size and range are not fixed and depend on the compiler and system architecture."

The resulting value is printed, demonstrating the wrap-around behavior typically seen in integer overflow (in two's complement systems, it wraps to the minimum value).  The code also includes a simple check to explicitly report whether an overflow has occurred based on the resulting value being less than the original maximum.  The output clearly shows the maximum, the result of the overflow, the minimum value, and a statement confirming the overflow."

Its primary purpose is to store and manipulate numerical data in various programming tasks.\n\nThe size of an `int` in memory is typically 4 bytes (32 bits), although this is implementation-defined and can vary depending on the compiler and the system architecture (e.g., it might be 2 bytes on some embedded systems).  This 32-bit representation allows it to store values within a specific range.  On a typical system, this range is approximately -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.\n\nDeclaration and usage are straightforward:\n\n```c++\nint age = 30;\nint count = 100;\nint sum = age + count; //Simple addition\nint difference = age - count; //Simple Subtraction\nint product = age * count; //Simple Multiplication\nint quotient = age / count; //Simple Division (integer division)\n```\n\nIt's crucial to understand integer overflow.  If you attempt to assign a value to an `int` variable that exceeds its maximum or minimum value, overflow occurs. This can lead to unexpected and incorrect results because the value \"wraps around\" to the opposite end of the range. For example, if you add 1 to the maximum value of an `int`, you might get the minimum value.\n\nIn situations where the range of an `int` is insufficient (e.g., working with very large numbers or numbers outside the +/-2 billion range), using a different integer type like `long long` (which typically provides 64 bits of storage), `short` (typically 2 bytes), or even `unsigned int` (which allows only positive values and extends the positive range) is essential to avoid overflow.  The choice of which type to use depends on the specific needs of your program and the expected size of the integers involved.  `unsigned int` is particularly useful when you're sure your integers will always be non-negative (e.g., counters or array indices).",
