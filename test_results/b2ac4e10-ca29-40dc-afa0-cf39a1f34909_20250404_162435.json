      "feedback": "The student's answer is completely inadequate.  'dwdq' provides no relevant information on memory management in C++, stack vs. heap allocation, or the mitigation of memory leaks and dangling pointers.  The answer demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the concepts covered in the question.  The student needs to review the fundamental concepts of C++ memory management.",
      "correct_answer": "C++ offers both stack and heap memory allocation, each with distinct characteristics impacting program design and performance.  The stack is a LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure that automatically manages memory. Variables declared within functions are typically allocated on the stack.  Its advantage is speed and simplicity; allocation and deallocation are handled implicitly when the function scope ends. However, stack memory is limited in size.  Attempting to allocate excessively large structures on the stack leads to stack overflow.\n\nThe heap, on the other hand, is a dynamically allocated memory pool.  Memory on the heap is explicitly requested using `new` and released using `delete` (for single objects) or `new[]` and `delete[]` (for arrays).  This provides greater flexibility; you can allocate memory as needed during program execution and deallocate it when it's no longer required.  However, manual memory management on the heap introduces the risk of errors.\n\nChoosing between stack and heap depends on the context:\n\n* **Stack:** Prefer the stack for local variables with known, relatively small sizes.  Their automatic management simplifies the code and prevents memory leaks.  Example: `int x = 10;` (x is allocated on the stack within the function's scope).\n\n* **Heap:** Use the heap when the size of the data is unknown at compile time or if the data needs to persist beyond the scope of a function.  Example: `int* y = new int[n];` (allocates an array of integers on the heap; `n` is determined at runtime).  Remember to always `delete[] y;` when you are finished with it to avoid memory leaks.\n\n\nImproper memory management is a significant source of bugs in C++.  Memory leaks occur when dynamically allocated memory is no longer needed but not released, gradually consuming system resources. Dangling pointers arise when a pointer refers to memory that has already been deallocated, leading to unpredictable behavior.  Smart pointers (like `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`) are powerful tools to mitigate these issues by automating memory management and preventing dangling pointers.  RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is a crucial principle; resources are acquired within constructors and released in destructors, guaranteeing resource cleanup even in exceptional situations.",
