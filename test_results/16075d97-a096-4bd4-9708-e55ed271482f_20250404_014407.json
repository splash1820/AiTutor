      "feedback": "The student's response, 'fafda', is completely irrelevant to the question.  The question asked for an explanation of the concept of an introduction (in the context of, presumably, a programming assignment or report) and then requested Java code for the Fibonacci sequence. The student's answer demonstrates a lack of understanding of the question, a failure to provide any relevant information, and a complete absence of Java code.  To improve, the student should first understand the question's two parts:  the introductory paragraph's purpose (setting context, stating the problem, outlining the approach) and then provide the requested Java code for generating the Fibonacci sequence.  A good answer would include a brief explanation of the Fibonacci sequence and then present well-commented, functional Java code.",

      "feedback": "The student's code submission, 'fdafda', is not valid Python code. It does not define a function or produce any output.  It fails to address the problem of creating a function called `solution` that returns the string 'result'. The test cases are irrelevant because the code is not executable.  To receive a passing grade, the student needs to write a Python function as specified in the expected solution.",
